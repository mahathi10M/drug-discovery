          <p>
            This tool allows users to input a SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) string ‚Äî 
            a textual representation of a chemical structure ‚Äî and receive a generated or modified molecule 
            based on AI-driven predictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you're a researcher, a student, or just curious about how molecules are created in drug 
            development, this tool provides a quick and interactive way to explore molecular possibilities.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-8 mb-3">Accelerating Drug Discovery</h3>
          <p>
            The process of drug discovery is time-consuming, expensive, and often inefficient, with a high rate 
            of failure in clinical trials. Traditional methods rely heavily on trial and error, requiring years 
            of research and significant financial investment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generative AI, with its ability to analyze large datasets, predict molecular interactions, and generate 
            novel compounds, has the potential to revolutionize this process, making it faster, more efficient, 
            and potentially more successful.
